# Alex and Tom's Programming Playground

### What is this place?
Funny you ask, because we don't know either.

```c
if(this turns into a cool project)
{
  it will be amazing;
}
```

For real though, currently (June 2020), We are working on an item system that will function similar to the one you see in Minecraft.

All item data is stored online in a database which the "game" reads and writes to.

If, for what ever reason, this project seems interesting to you, come join in the discussion...
